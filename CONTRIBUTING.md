# Contributing to ARN-DL

First off, thank you for your interest in contributing to ARN-DL! We appreciate all forms of feedback and engagement from the community.

The goal of these guidelines is to establish a clear and efficient process for collaboration. Following them helps maintain the project's quality and ensures all contributions align with its core objectives, making the experience better for everyone involved.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By participating, you agree to abide by its terms. Please read our [CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

## How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute, from reporting bugs to suggesting features. To make the process as efficient as possible, please follow these steps.

### Reporting Bugs üêõ or Suggesting Features üí°

The best way to start is by sharing your idea. All changes, big or small, should be discussed before any code is written.

* **For Bug Reports:** Please open an [**Issue**](https://github.com/ARN-Inside/ARN-DL/issues) and describe the problem with as much detail as possible. Include the link you used, the steps to reproduce the bug, and any error messages.
* **For Feature Ideas:** Please start a topic in the [**Discussions**](https://github.com/ARN-Inside/ARN-DL/discussions) tab. This is the best place to propose and refine new ideas for the project.

## Code Contribution Process

We welcome code contributions, but to save everyone's time and ensure changes align with the project's goals, we follow a "discussion-first" approach.

**Please do not open a Pull Request without first discussing your proposed change in an Issue or Discussion.**

#### The Process

1. **Find or Create an Issue/Discussion:** Find an existing topic you'd like to work on, or create a new one to propose your change.
2. **Get Approval:** Participate in the discussion and wait for the maintainer (ARN Inside) to approve the idea and give a green light for a Pull Request.
3. **Open a Pull Request:** Once you have approval, you can fork the repository, write your code, and open a Pull Request. Please make sure your PR:

   * References the original Issue or Discussion number (e.g., "Fixes #123").
   * Clearly describes the problem and your solution.
   * Has been tested to ensure it works and does not break other functionalities.

Pull Requests that are submitted without a prior discussion will likely be closed, and you will be asked to open a discussion first.

## Forking and Licensing Obligations

Please be aware that it is licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3.0**. Any public redistribution of a modified version **must also be licensed under GPLv3** and its source code must remain open.

Furthermore, respecting the original work includes providing **clear and proper attribution** to the original project and its author (ARN Inside).

Thank you for helping to improve ARN-DL!
