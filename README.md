## üöÄ One-Click Install
For the vast majority of users, getting started is incredibly simple:

1.  **Double-click `Setup.exe` and you're done.**
2.  This one-time utility automatically creates desktop and local shortcuts that handle all administrator permissions for you. This provides a seamless, UAC-prompt-free experience every time you launch the application.


## üç™ Using Cookies (Highly Recommended)

This step is often mandatory to help bypass anti-bot checks, access age-restricted content, and accept cookie banners.

1.  Use an extension like **"Get cookies.txt LOCALLY"** to copy your browser's cookies.
    * For the most reliable cookies, first open a new **Private/Incognito** browser window.
    * Ensure the extension is allowed to run in this mode in your browser's settings.
    * Log into the desired website (e.g., YouTube) *before* exporting the cookies.

2.  **Import into ARN-DL:** In the script's main menu, select **"Manage cookies"**. Paste the copied text into the `cookies.txt` file that opens and save it.

## üéµ The ARN Inside Audio Experience
ARN-DL is more than a tool; it's an experience. The custom audio ambiance, which features the "ARN Inside" brand name, is an integral part of this vision, designed to make every interaction memorable.

-   **Smart Audio Management**: The audio is designed to be non-intrusive. It **automatically pauses when you minimize the window** and resumes when you return, allowing you to run silent downloads in the background while enjoying the unique atmosphere when interacting with the app.

<summary><strong>üìñ User Guide: The Download Flow</strong></summary>

The script guides you through a series of menus to configure your download precisely.

1.  **Main Menu**: After starting, you are presented with the main menu. Here, you can choose to:
    -   Paste a single or multiple links.
    -   Manage cookies (opens `cookies.txt`).
    -   Access the Options menu.
    -   Update the tools or the script itself.
2.  **Format Selection Menu**: After providing a link, you'll be asked what you want to download:
    -   `Video`: Downloads the video with its audio track in a single file (MP4 or MKV).
    -   `Audio Only`: Downloads only the audio track and saves it as a high-quality `.wav` or `.mp3` file.
    -   `VIDEO + SEPARATE AUDIO`: Downloads the video file and also creates a separate, high-quality audio file.
3.  **Quality Selection Menu**: Next, you define the quality:
    -   **Video Quality**: Choose a maximum resolution, such as "High (Max 1080p)" or "Ultra (4k, 8k...)". The script will find the best available quality up to that limit.
    -   **Audio Quality**: If you are downloading audio, choose between `.WAV` (lossless, highest quality) and `.MP3` (high-bitrate, smaller file size).
4.  **Playlist Selection Menu**: If you enter a link to a playlist, a final menu appears. It lists all the videos in that playlist, allowing you to:
    -   Navigate through the list.
    -   Select or deselect individual videos.
    -   Press 'A' to select or deselect all videos at once.
    -   Press 'V' to validate your selection and begin downloading.

<summary><strong>‚öôÔ∏è Core Mechanisms: The Technical Implementation</strong></summary>

This section details the specific technical implementations that power ARN-DL, providing a look "under the hood" that the summary table cannot. This is the proof of how the script's features are achieved with a focus on resilience, quality, and user experience.

* **Seamless UAC Bypass via Scheduled Task**
    The "One-Click Install" is not a simple shortcut. The `Setup.exe` utility creates a **Windows Scheduled Task** configured to run the script with the highest privileges. The desktop shortcut then executes this task on demand (`schtasks /run`). This task has no automatic trigger and **only runs when you click the shortcut**, providing a secure and seamless method to gain the necessary permissions without recurring UAC prompts.

* **Intelligent Format Selection via Opinionated Sorting**
    Instead of a simple format request, the script uses `yt-dlp`'s powerful sort flag (`-S`) to enforce a quality hierarchy. For audio, the sort key `'hasaud,+codec:opus,abr,+ext:m4a,abr,quality'` prioritizes **Opus** audio streams, falling back to **AAC** (`ext=m4a`) only if Opus is unavailable. This ensures the best available audio codec is always chosen automatically.

* **Client Emulation via Iterative Retries**
    To bypass device-specific quality restrictions by emulating various clients (phone, TV)restrictions, the script maintains a list of client profiles (e.g., `web`, `ios`, `android_tv`). When a download fails, it programmatically **iterates through this list**, re-issuing the same download request with a different client identity header on each attempt. This methodical loop turns a single point of failure into multiple opportunities for success.

* **Exhaustive Brute-Force via a Test Matrix**
    This mode programmatically generates a **test matrix** of possibilities. It builds a "cascade" of format strings for every resolution, then enters a **nested loop**: for each format, it attempts a download using *every single client profile*. This systematic search (Formats x Clients) guarantees that if a working combination exists, the script will find it.

* **Windows-Compatible WAV Metadata**
    Generic metadata commands often create `.wav` files that are unreadable by Windows Explorer. To solve this, the script manually **reconstructs the RIFF file structure**. It reads the file byte by byte, isolates the `fmt` and `data` chunks, and writes a new file with a correctly formatted `LIST INFO` chunk, ensuring universal compatibility.

* **Responsive UI with a Non-Blocking Input Loop**
    The UI remains fluid thanks to a custom `Wait-KeyNonBlocking` function. Instead of freezing while waiting for input, it runs a high-frequency loop that checks for key presses (`[System.Console]::KeyAvailable`) while simultaneously updating background animations, creating a responsive, "asynchronous-style" experience.

* **Flicker-Free Console Rendering**
    The smooth animations are achieved with a double-buffering technique. For each frame, the script builds the next scene in an in-memory array, compares it to the previous frame, and then surgically updates **only the characters that have changed**, eliminating flickering.


* **Advanced Playlist Management with Pagination**
    To handle massive playlists without overwhelming the UI, the script implements a custom pagination system. The `Show-PlaylistSelectionMenu` function slices the full video list into manageable pages of 20 items using PowerShell's `Select-Object -Skip/-First` cmdlets. It maintains a persistent list of selected indices that works **across all pages**, allowing the user to navigate with arrow keys, make granular selections, and select/deselect all, providing complete control over playlists of any size.

<summary><strong>üõ†Ô∏è Advanced & Manual Installation</strong></summary>

### Manual Shortcut Creation (Alternative Method)

This section is for advanced users or for those who encounter issues with the standard `Setup.exe` installer.

-   **Important Trade-off**: Using this manual method will cause Windows to show a **UAC (administrator approval) pop-up** *every time you launch the script*. The standard installation method avoids this.

1.  **Navigate to the Script Folder**: Open the main application folder and go into the `Data_Inside` directory.
2.  **Create a Shortcut to Desktop**:
    -   Locate the `ARN-DL.ps1` file. Right-click on it.
    -   *Note for Windows 11 users*: You may need to click "Show more options".
    -   Go to "Send to" and then select "Desktop (create shortcut)".
3.  **Configure the Shortcut Properties**:
    -   Go to your desktop, find the new shortcut, right-click on it, and choose "Properties".
    -   In the "Shortcut" tab, locate the "Target" field. You must **replace its entire content** with the command below.
    -   Copy and paste the following full command into the "Target" field, which includes an example path:
        ```
        C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile -File "C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\...\Data_Inside\ARN-DL.ps1"
        ```
    -   **CRITICAL:** You must now manually edit the example path to match the **exact location** of your `ARN-DL.ps1` file.

4.  **Set Administrator Privileges**:
    -   While still in "Properties", click the "Advanced..." button.
    -   Check the box for "Run as administrator" and click "OK".
5.  **Apply and Finish**: Click "Apply" and then "OK". You can now rename the shortcut to "ARN-DL".

<summary><strong>‚úçÔ∏è A Note from the Author: Project Philosophy</strong></summary>

ARN-DL is a labor of love, freely offered to the community after two months of hard work. Considerable effort was expended to create not only a functional tool, but also a unique user experience, striving for "divine perfection"! The musical and aesthetic choices are a deliberate tribute to the monumental work of Terry A. Davis, reflecting the creative ambition of the project:

Terry A. Davis built an entire operating system by himself, a digital temple born from a revelation. Imagine his creative power, augmented by cloud AI, if he were still with us today.

#### About the integrated audio and author signature
The audio experience is an integral part of ARN-DL's design and brand identity. To preserve this vision, the script includes an author's signature that verifies the integrity of the core audio components. This feature is also a cultural "easter egg." As this project is fully open-source, the code can naturally be modified. This signature therefore acts not as a technical barrier, but as a clear statement of authorial intent and a safeguard for the project's artistic identity.

This project is shared under the GPLv3 license, which grants you extensive freedoms to modify and share the code. However, the spirit of open-source is collaboration and improvement. Redistributing a modified version where the sole change is the removal of the project's identity and artistic signature, without adding any other value, is contrary to this spirit. I ask that you respect the original work and authorship.
