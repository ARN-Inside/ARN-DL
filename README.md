* **Post-Download Toolkit**: Includes options for re-encoding MKV files to the more compatible MP4 format and automatically injecting metadata into downloaded files.
* **Integrated Updater**: Keeps the script and its core dependencies (yt-dlp, FFmpeg) up-to-date with a single command.
* **Companion Icon Utility**: A batch script is included to create a desktop shortcut, making it easy to launch ARN-DL.

## Getting Started

ARN-DL is designed as a portable, self-contained application. The goal is to provide a tool that works out-of-the-box with zero setup, ensuring both ease of use and long-term stability.

* **Instant Usability**: There is no need to manually install dependencies like `yt-dlp` or `FFmpeg`. Everything is included, allowing you to use the application immediately after downloading.
* **Guaranteed Stability**: By packaging all dependencies directly, we ensure that ARN-DL always runs with a specific, tested set of components. This prevents unexpected bugs or compatibility issues from external updates, guaranteeing a consistent and reliable experience.

### 1. Run the Setup Utility

Run the `Setup.exe` file located in the script directory.

This is a one-time setup utility that will configure ARN-DL for a seamless experience. 
It creates a desktop shortcut and uses the Windows Task Scheduler to handle administrator permissions automatically. 
This ensures you won't be prompted by UAC (the administrator approval pop-up) every time you launch the script.

### 2. Launch the Application

Double-click the newly created "ARN-DL" desktop icon to start the application.

### 3. Using Cookies (Optional)

For the best results, especially with websites that use anti-bot protections, it is highly recommended to use cookies from your browser.

1.  When you first run the script, a `cookies.txt` file is created in the same folder.
2.  Open this file in a text editor and follow the instructions inside to export your browser cookies using a recommended extension like **Get cookies.txt LOCALLY**.
3.  Paste the exported text into the `cookies.txt` file and save it.

This step allows ARN-DL to download age-restricted content, private videos (from your account), and bypass most "prove you are human" checks.

## TROUBLESHOOTING: MANUAL SHORTCUT CREATION -

If the "Setup.exe" fails or the desktop shortcut doesn't work, follow these steps to create a functional shortcut manually.

1.  **Navigate to the Script Folder**:
    Open the main application folder and go into the `Data_Inside` directory.

2.  **Create a Shortcut to Desktop**:
    * Locate the `ARN-DL.ps1` file.
    * Right-click on the `ARN-DL.ps1` file.
    * Note for Windows 11 users: You may need to click "Show more options" to see the full context menu.
    * Go to "Send to" and then select "Desktop (create shortcut)".

3.  **Configure the Shortcut Properties**:
    * Go to your desktop, find the new shortcut, right-click on it, and choose "Properties".
    * In the "Shortcut" tab, locate the "Target" field.
    * The `Target` field will already contain the path to the script. You need to add a command in front of it. Click at `Target` field and paste the following text:
    
      `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile -File "C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\...\ARN-DL\Data_Inside\ARN-DL.ps1"`
    
      * Important: After pasting, you must verify that the file path inside the quotes ("...") correctly points to your ARN-DL.ps1 file.

4.  **Set Administrator Privileges**:
    * While still in the "Properties" window, click the "Advanced..." button.
    * Check the box for "Run as administrator" and click "OK".

5.  **Apply and Finish**:
    * Click "Apply" and then "OK" to save the changes.
    * You can now rename the shortcut to "ARN-DL" for clarity. Double-clicking this new shortcut will launch the application with the correct settings.

## User Guide: The Download Flow

The script guides you through a series of menus to configure your download precisely.

1.  **Main Menu**: After starting, you are presented with the main menu. Here, you can choose to:
    * Paste a single or multiple links.
    * Manage cookies (opens `cookies.txt`).
    * Access the Options menu.
    * Update the tools or the script itself.

2.  **Format Selection Menu**: After providing a link, you'll be asked what you want to download:
    * **Video**: Downloads the video with its audio track in a single file (MP4 or MKV).
    * **Audio Only**: Downloads only the audio track and saves it as a high-quality `.wav` or `.mp3` file.
    * **VIDEO + SEPARATE AUDIO**: Downloads the video file and also creates a separate, high-quality audio file.

3.  **Quality Selection Menu**: Next, you define the quality:
    * **Video Quality**: Choose a maximum resolution, such as "High (Max 1080p)" or "Ultra (4k, 8k...)". The script will find the best available quality up to that limit.
    * **Audio Quality**: If you are downloading audio, choose between `.WAV` (lossless, highest quality) and `.MP3` (high-bitrate, smaller file size).

4.  **Playlist Selection Menu**: If you enter a link to a playlist, a final menu appears. It lists all the videos in that playlist, allowing you to:
    * Navigate through the list.
    * Select or deselect individual videos.
    * Press 'A' to select or deselect all videos at once.
    * Press 'V' to validate your selection and begin downloading.

## In-Depth: Core Mechanisms Explained

ARN-DL is built on several layers of technology to ensure a high success rate for downloads.

### Intelligent Format Selection

Instead of just grabbing the "best" format available, the script performs a **Smart Analysis** when you provide a link. It fetches a complete list of all available video and audio streams, then filters them based on your quality selection (e.g., max 1080p). It prioritizes modern, high-quality codecs like AV1/VP9 for video and Opus for audio, which are typically found in separate streams. If these are available, it downloads them and merges them into a high-quality MKV or MP4 container.

### Multi-Stage Fallback Engine

If the initial Smart Analysis fails, the script doesn't just give up. It initiates a fallback sequence:
1.  **Container Fallback**: If the preferred container (e.g., MKV with Opus audio) fails, it will automatically try a more compatible combination (e.g., MP4 with AAC audio).
2.  **Generic Fallback**: If specific format selection fails, it will ask for the `bestvideo+bestaudio` streams and attempt to merge them.
3.  **Last Resort Fallback**: If all else fails, it will attempt to download into the *other* primary container format as a last-ditch effort.

This multi-layered approach ensures that even if one method is blocked, another is likely to succeed.

### Client Emulation

Some websites serve different media files depending on the device making the request. ARN-DL leverages this by cycling through different **client profiles** (like `web`, `ios`, `android`, `tv_embedded`). If a download fails with the default client, it will retry the same request while pretending to be another device, often bypassing blocks that target standard desktop browsers.

### Cookie Management

The script automatically creates and manages a `cookies.txt` file. When this file contains valid, Netscape-formatted cookies, `yt-dlp` will include them with every download request. This makes your requests appear as if they are coming from a logged-in browser session. This is essential for accessing private content, bypassing age-gates, and avoiding CAPTCHA challenges.

### Brute-Force Mode

When Smart Analysis isn't enough, you can enable **Brute-Force Mode**. This is the script's ultimate weapon. It generates a comprehensive list of every possible resolution and codec combination and systematically tries to download each one, iterating through every available client profile for each attempt. While extremely slow, this method is designed to find a working combination for even the most problematic and heavily protected video links.

### Post-Download Processing

Once a file is downloaded, ARN-DL can perform additional tasks:
* **High-Quality Re-encoding**: If you download a `.mkv` file but need a more compatible `.mp4`, the script can re-encode it using FFmpeg. It uses `libx264` with a quality-focused CRF setting and high-bitrate AAC audio to minimize quality loss.
* **Metadata Injection**: The script automatically uses FFmpeg to write a "Downloaded by ARN-DL" comment into the file's metadata, making it easy to identify where your files came from.

## A Note on the Integrated Audio Experience

ARN-DL is a labor of love, offered to the community for free. A great deal of effort went into creating not just a functional tool, but also a unique user experience, complete with custom animations and a distinct audio ambiance.

The choice of music is a deliberate tribute to the monumental work of Terry A. Davis. It reflects the project's own creative ambition:

> Terry A. Davis built an entire OS alone, a digital temple dictated by a revelation. Imagine his creative power with today's AI and cloud capabilities. This is the scale of creation I'm aiming for.

To preserve this intended experience, the script includes an **integrity check mechanism**. At startup and during runtime, it verifies that the core audio files (`ARN_Inside.wav` and the TempleOS remix) are present and have not been modified by checking their unique digital signatures (SHA256 hashes).

If these files are missing or altered, the application will lock down to protect and preserve user experience. We kindly ask users to respect the work put into this project by not modifying or removing these core audio components.
